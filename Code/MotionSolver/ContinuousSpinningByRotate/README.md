# Details for implementation

## Motion parameters: displacement (d) and energy (E)

When the kinetic unit is added to the selected body, the body is split into three pieces-head, body, and tail. The head has a long bar with a hook on the tip sitting in the center. The body is replaced with a helical spring, which has parameters determined by the input motion design. The tail has a cavity for the lock and a trigger extended to the surface. Please refer to the Rhino model design of the helical unit.

## The workflow is:

1. The user adjusts the motion parameters for a desired motion;
2. The user specifies the motion direction;
3. The user selects the target model body;
4. The user selects a position candidate for embedding the kinetic unit;
5. The user selects an orientation for the kinetic unit;
6. Preview the embedded kinetic unit in place and simulation of the motion.
